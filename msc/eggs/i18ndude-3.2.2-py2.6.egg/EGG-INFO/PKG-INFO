        Changelog
        =========
        
        3.2.2 (2010-12-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Encode key to utf-8 for the Merge-Warning message to avoid a
        UnicodeEncodeError.
        [mikerhodes]
        
        
        3.2.1 (2010-10-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed making POT file for DOUBLE BYTE strings on default.
        [terapyon]
        
        
        3.2 (2010-09-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Replaced internal odict implementation by the ordereddict package.
        (implementation backported from Python 2.7)
        [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.1.3 (2010-09-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid UnicodeDecodeError when printing warning message in add().
        [rnix]
        
        
        3.1.2 (2010-02-14)
        ------------------
        
        - elementtree is only required for Python < 2.5.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Fixed tests (patch provided by John Trammell).
        [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.1.1 (2009-11-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Strip "src" only once in the pathname for the comments.
        Example: before it generated the following comment
        "#: archetypes.referencebrowserwidget/"
        which was not so useful. Now it generates
        "archetypes.referencebrowserwidget/src/archetypes/referencebrowserwidget/..."
        [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.1 (2009-10-31)
        ----------------
        
        - Support for explicit msgids in GSReader.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Better handling of msgid references. Keep all the references in PTReader
        and PYReader. In POWriter, normalize and sort the references, write only
        MAX_OCCUR (default is 3) references.
        You can set MAX_OCCUR=None if you want all references to be written to
        the generated POT file. Only the first reference is written in case of
        several references to the same file but with different line number.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Depend now on zope.tal 3.5.2 to print a warning when msgid already exists
        in catalog with a different default message. Simplified PTReader code.
        Check for msgid with different default in GSReader, PYReader and in the
        merged catalog (ptctl, pyctl, gsctl).
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Fix behaviour when dealing with broken xml files to be parsed.
        [afd]
        
        
        3.0 (2008-11-13)
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        3.0c1 (2008-10-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed major bug introduced in the kupu changes. We didn't include
        cpt pages anymore.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Updated the table output with some styling tips from limi.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added a new -t option to the list command. This will output a simple
        HTML page with some colored progress bars instead of the simple text
        listing.
        [hannosch, limi]
        
        - Ripped out the long unmaintained chart and combinedchart commands.
        Added a new list command instead, which shows the translation status
        in a simple listing.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        3.0b4 (2008-04-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated documentation.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed parsing of projects without any i18n in page templates. It is
        sufficient to have i18n in Python files or in GS profiles.
        [naro]
        
        - Added special handling of some more entities to please kupu.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Applied kupu-i18nextract-sa-diff.patch from kupu to be able to rebuild
        the kupu pot files from xsl and html files.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Normalize path separators in references to `/` on all platforms.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Reverted undocumented c58402, which broke in presence of Unicode strings.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Strip the computer specific base folder from generated references.
        [hannosch]
        
        - On most errors, show the error and a very short help message,
        instead of the complete doc string of the file.
        [maurits]
        
        
        3.0b3 (2007-09-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Stripped some more trailing whitespace. Fixed recursive algorithm for
        i18n domain extraction.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed some bugs in the GenericSetup extraction handler. Messages defined
        on the root node will now be extracted as well. The message texts are
        stripped from beginning and trailing whitespace.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        3.0b2 (2007-06-05)
        ------------------
        
        - No longer replace &hellip; and &mdash; with simple ASCII equivalents, but
        use proper Unicode characters, properly representing these HTML entities.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed some minor bugs found while rebuilding the Plone pot files.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added basic Unicode support to the MessageCatalog class.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed comment handling in the merge command.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Made gdchart dependency for the combinedchart command optional. Instead
        you only get a textual listing right now.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Quote new lines in the default comment properly.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added support for extracting i18n:attributes from GenericSetup profiles.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added a new basic GenericSetup profile extractor, which automatically
        extracts messages marked with i18n:translate.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added back support for specifying multiple folders to be searched in the
        rebuilt-pot command.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added new --exclude argument to the rebuilt-pot command, which lets you
        specify a whitespace delimited list of files that should not be included
        in the message extraction.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added automatic replace from '&#8230;' to '...'.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        3.0b1 (2007-03-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed bug in mixing different catalogs into one. It wouldn't respect the
        default value of messages extracted from Python code. Also don't extract
        messages from translate and utranslate functions anymore, because they
        have a different call signature.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Whitespace fix for filename filter.
        [sunew]
        
        - Improved the regular expression used in find_untranslated, so that it
        also matches tags beginning with capital letters.
        [kclarks]
        
        - Removed custom TAL parser. Use the one from zope.tal.talgettext instead.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Integrate extract.py and interfaces.py from zope.app.locales. Got rid of
        our own version of TokenEater and the whole pystrings.py file.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        2.1.1 (2006-10-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Use entry_points console_scripts from setuptools to install the main
        script. This should generate an executable file on Windows platforms.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Removed some unused test files.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Corrected the package information in the setup.py. Figured out how to
        use find_packages() with the correct arguments.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        2.1 (2006-09-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Refactored the package source code layout to comply to the usual best
        practices.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added framework classifiers to the package metadata.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Some small refinements to setup.py. i18ndude is now registered in the
        Cheese Shop and you can get the current development version just by
        typing 'easy_install i18ndude' :)
        [hannosch]
        
        - Egg enabled i18ndude. The next release will be available as an egg. If you
        are in a development environment you might want to reinstall i18ndude by
        using 'python setup.py develop' instead of 'python setup.py install' now,
        so you don't have to do this whenever something changes in SVN :)
        [hannosch]
        
        - Sorted textual output of the combinedchart option by language code.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Clarified the 'already exists with different text' message by providing
        the location of the original text as well.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the 'Assuming rendered msgid' warning messages. These only clutter
        the logs but don't provide any real value.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed tests, so they can be run with the normal Zope testrunner.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Disabled external namespace validation for find-untranslated so you can
        run it without network access and results in a major speed increase.
        Thx to Chuck Bearden for the patch. This closes
        http://plone.org/products/i18ndude/i18ndudetracker/1
        [hannosch, encolpe]
        
        - Remove the 'addPortalMessage' again from the list of python functions
        whose argument should be translated. We do these with proper MessageID's
        now.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Exclude folders named 'tests' from subfolder scanning. Page templates and
        Python code from tests shouldn't be scanned for i18n tags.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fix the broken admix option.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Update the usage info to reflect the removal of the silent option.
        [hannosch, frisi]
        
        - Fixed yet another issue regarding whitespace and provided test for it.
        [hannosch, Tuttle]
        
        - Change output of references's containing '//' to conform to the poEdit
        format.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Change output of msgstr's containing newline codes (\n) to conform to the
        gettext standard and specifically the poEdit format.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Don't add fuzzy status to empty messages anymore.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0 (2005-10-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed two unsupported scripts, if you have used them please tell me
        [hannosch]
        
        - Refactored sync option into function of catalog.py and wrote test for it.
        Fixing a bug along the way and did some code cleanup.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added option to specify title of chart explicitly
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added combinedchart option, which is used to build the overview charts
        on plone.org for a comprehensive view on the status of translations.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the extract literals feature. If anybody needs it, please speak up.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Updated visualisation.py to handle new internal catalog format.
        Provided basic test for it.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added new feature to PTReader. For msgid's which are already in the
        catalog, check if the msgstr matches or provide an error message.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed another issue regarding missing whitespace and provided test for it
        [hannosch, Tuttle]
        
        - POWriter generates new default comments instead of the old original
        comments. POParser automatically converts existing original comments
        (# Original: "") or Zope3-style default comments (# Default: "") at the
        reading step to new default comments (#. Default: "").
        
        - PTReader now doesn't extracts any excerpts anymore.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the silent option on rebuilt, merge and sync completly. The
        addition of the added- and removed-sections lead to an incorrect format.
        Use a normal diff tool if you are really interessted in this information.
        [hannosch]
        
        - PYReader now extracts the line numbers of messages and writes these at
        the end of the reference seperated with a ':'
        [hannosch]
        
        - The catalog's add method doesn't adds duplicate references or automatic
        comments anymore. Test were updated to reflect new behaviour.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed handling of normal comments in PT- and PYReader.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Always add a blank line as the last line on po's, as poEdit does it
        [hannosch]
        
        - Adjusted Python parsing tests to cover the current behaviour. Added XXX
        comments where it is wrong
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed an issue with an unnecessary whitespace and provided test for it
        [hannosch, Tuttle]
        
        - Based all of catalog.py on the new MessageEntry class.
        Rewrote POWriter to use new gettext standard conform output.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0 (2005-09-02)
        ----------------
        
        - This is the last release with old-stlye output formatting and command line
        options. The next release will be incompatible in many ways, so update
        with care.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Cleaned up docs and removed some stale files
        [hannosch]
        
        - untranslated.py: fixed handling of new i18n:attributes with trailing
        semicolon as introduced by myself ;) thx to xaNz for pointing me to it
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added a new MessageEntry class to base the MessageCatalog on, added new
        default_comment constant, reformated the Changelog as HISTORY.txt
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed path handling in tests and wrote tests for PYParser
        [deo]
        
        - Adjusted tests to pass on new behaviour of 'unneeded literal msgids'
        now getting added and warning shown
        [hannosch]
        
        - Instead of only showing a warning about 'unneeded literal msgids'
        these get added now
        [tuttle]
        
        - move the utils.py from PloneTranslations here, Removed ## X more comments
        [hannosch]
        
        - Preserve special ## comments, added tests for special comments,
        started PageTemplate parsing tests
        [hannosch]
        
        - added test for po file writing and allowed filenames without excerpt
        (lines starting with #: without corresponding #. lines)
        [hannosch]
        
        - added test infrastructure and tests for po file parsing
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fix an issue in merge option when trying to merge two files
        [hannosch]
        
        
        0.6 (2005-07-04)
        ----------------
        
        - tagged and released 0.6
        [batlogg]
        
        - pystring: add 'addPortalMessage' to the list of python functions whose
        argument should be translated. This allows to catch the new-style portal-
        messages in Plone 2.1 to be automagically extracted
        [hannosch]
        
        
        0.5 (2005-06-14)
        ----------------
        
        - tagged and released 0.5
        [batlogg]
        
        - as html-entities in msgstr's are bad, don't provide them in the original
        comments. this has confused translators.
        [hannosch]
        
        - untranslated.py: Added a new handler available through a command line
        switch, generally ignore text in script and style tags
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed whitespace error in generation of #, fuzzy comments
        [hannosch]
        
        - i18ndude now takes a second pot to merge in the merge and rebuild-pot
        commands, this is useful if you have both a manual.pot and a generated.pot
        [hannosch]
        
        - catalog.py (MessageCatalog) added a new method addToSameFileName() which
        adds in a msgid but adds the excerpt to an existing filename occurrence
        This is used in i18ngenerator.py of PloneTranslations to add in actions
        like "Edit" as msgids and adds all types these are definied to the same
        occurrence rather than generating a new one for each type
        [hannosch]
        
        - catalog.py (POWriter.write) takes a new argument noMoreComments that
        supresses the "## xx More..." comments
        [hannosch]
        
        - Also fill in the Original comments when parsing i18n:attributes
        This allows for efficient handling of named i18n:attributes
        [hannosch]
        
        - Refactored the English Translation stuff and renamed it to Original
        [hannosch]
        
        - When syncing po-files the old and new original comments are compared and
        the msgid is set to fuzzy if these aren't the same, meaning the msgid has
        changed and needs some verification
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added optional allcomments argument and get_original() method
        These are used in the latest PloneTranslations tests to compare
        the original value of a msgid with the msgstr
        [hannosch]
        
        - Set chart width to 1000px. Plone has too many translations ;)
        [hannosch]
        
        - Included a new option to scan python scripts for messages.
        Currently it looks for the _(), translate() and uranslate()
        functions. It is based on pygettext.py from Python and some
