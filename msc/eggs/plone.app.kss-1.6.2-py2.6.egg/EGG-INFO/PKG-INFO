Description: plone.app.kss
        =============
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This product gives generic KSS support for Plone. It depends on the product
        ``kss.core``.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Compatible with Zope 2.12, and Plone 4.0.
        
        Features implemented
        --------------------
        
        - Content tab replacer. This works with all the content (aka. "green") tabs
        including the non-action tabs in the setup screens. (put to experimental
        rules, by default off)
        
        As we have no way to identify a macro for the content-region in the current
        templating system of Plone, we render down the whole template. As a speedup,
        we replace the main_template in the rendering context, this may or may not
        have an effect depending on the template. If we cannot find a template at
        all, we fall back to submit.
        
        - Portlet refresher
        
        We currently refresh the "recent" portlet. The rendering of the portlet is
        done by the general macro renderer, the portlet is then replaced in the
        client in its position.
        
        There is one rule that is refreshing all the portlets, the only change
        that needs to be done in the Plone templates is put a KssPortletRefresh
        class to those portlet's outer <dl> tag that need to be refreshed.
        Refreshing is done in every 30 seconds currently, this can be adjusted
        from the template.
        
        - In-place calendar navigation: the two little arrows replace the calendar
        portlet, without reloading the screen.
        
        We put kss attributes on the calendar node for the year and month
        to tell the server where to navigate. Actually, we could have done
        that without modifying the template either, since the server could
        have just received the original "href" of the little arrow and could
        parse the year and month from that, but this is a cleaner solution.
        
        KSS extensions defined for general purpose use
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        - A generic macro replacer server action
        
        - client action for submitting to an url
        
        - client action for submitting the current form

        ------------------
        
        - Made kss attribute tests pass on both Plone 3.2 and 3.3.
        Difference: on 3.3 contentview-history was removed and inline

        [maurits]
        
        1.4.4 (2009-03-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Correct invalid use of jq.unbind
        [davisagli]
        
        1.4.3 (2008-08-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Translate message and message type passed to
        PloneCommands.issuePortalMessage.
        This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7282
        [maurits]
        
        - Adjusted deprecation warnings to point to Plone 4.0 instead of Plone 3.5
        since we changed the version numbering again.
        [hannosch]
        
        1.4.2 (2008-07-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Make the plugin tolerant if jQuery is not present,
        and not have a "jq" reference error in this case.
        Previously any kss pages (for example, demos) that
        did not use jQuery, failed with a javascript error
        in the presense of this plugin.
        During this, most things seemed to be working,
        apart from any plugins that were missing because
        they were to be loaded after the error.

        1.4.1 (2008-06-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Made the kss.demo dependency optional.
        [hannosch]
        
        1.4 (2008-04-21)
        ----------------
        
        - add selenium tests that at the moment are only
        runnable with a special branch of kss.demo,
        available from ploneout.
        [ree]
        
        - use refreshViewlet instead of macroContent in subscribers
        (closes #7879)
        [gotcha)
        
        1.2 (2007-08-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix bugs and test layer
        [ree, gotcha, jvloothuis, nouri]
        
        1.2-rc2 (2007-07-27)
        --------------------
        
        - External links is not always loaded anymore
        [gotcha]
        
        1.2-rc1.1 (2007-07-12)
        ----------------------
        
        - Prepare for release
        [ree]
        
        1.2-rc1 (2007-07-08)
        --------------------
        
        - Cleaned up Acquisition usage. self.context always needs to be unwrapped
        by aq_inner before using it in Zope2.
        [hannosch]
        
        1.2-beta2 (2007-04-30)
        ----------------------
        
        - Prepare for release
        [ree]
        
        1.2-beta1.2 (2007-03-23)
        ------------------------
        
        - Add monkeypatch to offer a temporary workaround to
        five.localsitemanager. This is actually not a kss issue,
        but the problem manifests when any other non-five site manager
        (like kss's one) is used together fith five's one. The
        result is, acquisition wrapping is not added in this case, and
        tools in Plone are returned without a parent. The current patch
        relocates the adding of the acquisition wrapping from the
        localsitemanager of five to the level of zope3. Thus acquisition
        will always be added.
        This is actually not a proper solution and is added from the wrong
        place at the moment.

        1.2-beta1 (2007-03-04)
        ----------------------
        
        - prepare for release
        [ree]

        -----------------------
        
        - adjust for release
        [ree]
