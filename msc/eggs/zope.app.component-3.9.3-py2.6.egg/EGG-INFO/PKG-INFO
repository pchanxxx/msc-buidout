Description: NOTE: this package is deprecated. Its functionality has been moved to
        more reusable packages, namely: zope.component, zope.security, zope.site
        and zope.componentvocabulary. Please import from there instead.
        
        This package provides various ZCML directives (view, resource) and a
        user interface related to local component management.

        =======
        
        3.9.3 (2011-07-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Replaced an undeclared test dependency on ``zope.app.authentication`` with
        ``zope.password``.
        
        - Removed unneeded dependencies.
        
        
        3.9.2 (2010-09-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Replaced a testing dependency on ``zope.app.securitypolicy`` with one on
        ``zope.securitypolicy``.
        
        
        3.9.1 (2010-09-01)
        ------------------
        
        - No longer using deprecated ``zope.testing.doctest``. Use python's build-in
        ``doctest`` instead.
        
        - Replaced the dependency on ``zope.deferredimport`` with BBB imports.
        
        
        3.9.0 (2010-07-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Added missing BBB import in ``zope.app.component.metaconfigure``.
        
        - Requiring at least ``zope.component`` 3.8 where some modules have
        moved which are BBB imported here.
        
        
        3.8.4 (2010-01-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Import hooks functionality from zope.component after it was moved there from
        zope.site.
        
        - Import ISite and IPossibleSite from zope.component after they were moved
        there from zope.location. This lifts the direct dependency on zope.location.
        
        - Fix tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.
        
        3.8.3 (2009-07-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed unnecessary dependency on ``zope.app.interface``.
        
        
        3.8.2 (2009-05-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix missing import in ``zope.app.component.metadirectives``.
        
        
        3.8.1 (2009-05-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Add deprecation note.
        
        3.8.0 (2009-05-21)
        ------------------
        
        - IMPORTANT: this package is now empty except for some ZMI definitions
        in zope.app.component.browser. Functionality from this package has
        been moved to ``zope.site``, ``zope.componentvocabulary`` and
        ``zope.component``, so preferably import from those locations.
        
        - zope.componentvocabulary has the vocabulary implementations that
        were in zope.app.componentvocabulary now, import them from there for
        backwards compatibility.
        
        - moved zope:resource and zope:view directive implementation and tests
        over into zope.component [zcml].
        
        3.7.0 (2009-04-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed deprecated `zope:defaultView` directive and its
        implementation.  New directive to set default view is
        `browser:defaultView`.
        
        3.6.1 (2009-03-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Make ``class`` directive schemas importable from old location,
        raising a deprecation warning. It was moved in the previous release,
        but some custom directives could possibly use its schemas.
        
        - Deprecate import of ClassDirective to announce about new location.
        
        - Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org,
        because zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.
        
        - Adapt to the move of IDefaultViewName from zope.component.interfaces
        to zope.publisher.interfaces.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Moved the implementation of the <class> directive from this package to
        `zope.security`.  In particular, the module
        `zope.app.component.contentdirective` has moved to
        `zope.security.metaconfigure`, and a compatibility import has been
        left in its place.
        
        - Extracted `zope.site` from zope.app.component with backwards
        compatibility imports in place. Local site related functionality
        is now in `zope.site` and packages should import from there.
        
        - Remove more deprecated on 3.5 code:
        
        * zope.app.component.fields module that was pointing to the
        removed back35's LayerField.
        * zope.app.component.interface module that was moved to
        zope.component.interface ages ago.
        * zope:content and zope:localUtility directives.
        * zope:factory directive.
        * deprecated imports in zope.component.metaconfigure
        * browser:tool directive and all zope.component.browser
        meta.zcml stuff.
        
        - Remove "back35" extras_require as it doesn't make
        any sense now.
        
        - Remove zope.modulealias test dependency as it is
        not used anywhere.
        
        - Deprecate ISite and IPossibleSite imports from
        zope.app.component.interfaces. They were moved
        to zope.location.interfaces ages ago. Fix imports
        in zope.app.component itself.
        
        3.5.0 (2008-10-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Remove deprecated code slated for removal on 3.5.
        
        3.4.1 (2007-10-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.
        
        
        3.4.0 (2007-10-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
