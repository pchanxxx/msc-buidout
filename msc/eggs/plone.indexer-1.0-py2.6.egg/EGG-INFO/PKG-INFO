Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides primitives to help delegate ZCatalog indexing operations
        to adapters. It doesn't do very much on its own, but can be used by catalog
        implementations that want to allow individual index values to be provided
        not by the object itself, but by separate adapters.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0 - 2010-07-18

        1.0rc2 - 2009-04-05
        -------------------
        
        - Added _getWrappedObject() method to get hold of the underlying object.
        Note that this means you can't have an index/metadata column with this name.

        - Corrected IZCatalog import location to point to the interfaces module.

        1.0rc1 - 2009-03-26
        -------------------
        
        - Updated the interface to match the developments of similar functionality
        on CMF trunk. This means that indexers are now multi-adapters on
        (object, catalog), and the keyword arguments (including the implicit
        'portal' parameter) are gone.
