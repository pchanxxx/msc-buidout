Description: 
        PrintingMailHost
        ================
        
        This is a hack. :)
        
        This product, when installed, will check if Zope is running in debug mode,
        and if so, monkey patch (that is, grab the internals of, squeeze tight, then
        rip hard, just like monkeys do) Zope's MailHost class, meaning that *any and
        all* uses of a MailHost will be "fixed" so that instead of sending mail, it
        prints messages to the standard output.
        
        This is useful if you don't have a local mailhost for testing, or if you
        prefer not to spam the crap out of yourself whilst finding out if your bulk
        mail script is working.
        
        If Zope is not running in debug mode, it will not install itself. However,
        I wouldn't recommend putting it on a production site. You never know what
        those monkeys may get up to...
        
        You can optionally enable the PrintingMailHost with an environment variable
        as of version 0.3.  See the installation instructions for more information
        about how to use it.

        Fixed to work both with old-style and new-style classes. Extended
        to also patch SecureMailBase from SecureMailHost, if available.

        Products.PrintingMailHost Installation
        ======================================
        
        To install Products.PrintingMailHost into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        - When you're reading this you have probably already run
        ``easy_install Products.PrintingMailHost``. Find out how to install setuptools
        (and EasyInstall) here:
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        - Add ``Products.PrintingMailHost`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        Products.PrintingMailHost
        
        - If you want to enable PrintingMailHost when debug-mode is off::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        environment-vars =
        ...
        ENABLE_PRINTING_MAILHOST True
        
        - If you want to disable PrintingMailHost when debug-mode is on::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        environment-vars =
        ...
        ENABLE_PRINTING_MAILHOST False
        
        - Re-run buildout in order to make any of the above changes active::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
