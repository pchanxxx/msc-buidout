        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.0.1 - 2011-01-03
        ------------------
        
        - Add Site Administrator to the default roles for the
        "plone.portlet.static: Add static portlet" permission, for forward
        compatibility with Plone 4.1.
        [davisagli]
        
        2.0 - 2010-07-18
        ----------------
        
        - Removed the deprecated `hide` option form the portlet.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Update license to GPL version 2 only.
        [hannosch]
        
        2.0b2 - 2010-02-17
        ------------------
        
        - Removed the transformation cache from the portlet renderer. Portal transforms
        doesn't actually work with the assignment class as a cache context.
        This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10167.
        [hannosch]
        
        2.0b1 - 2009-12-02
        ------------------
        
        - Removed Kupu as a testing dependency. In Plone 4 the tests work with the
        default TinyMCE transforms.
        [hannosch]
        
        2.0a2 - 2009-11-18
        ------------------
        
        - Removed reference to non-existent profile in plone.app.portlets.
        [hannosch]
        
        2.0a1 - 2009-11-13
        ------------------
        
        - Remove the "hide" option as this is now available to all portlets (PLIP 9286)
        [igbun]
        
        - Adjusted test setup to Plone 5.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added the z3c.autoinclude entry point so this package is automatically loaded
        on Plone 3.3 and above.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Declare test dependencies in an extra.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Specify package dependencies.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added 'tile' CSS class to the links within dt.portletHeader and
        dd.portletFooter for static portlet's template
        [spliter]
        
        1.2.1 - 2009-11-25
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a syntax error introduced in the last change.
        [hannosch]
        
        1.2 - 2009-11-25
        ----------------
        
        - Ensure that text output is passed through the safe-html transform to protect
        against malicious text. This also ensures the resolve uid behavior works when
        only TinyMCE and not Kupu is installed.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Removed msgids in portlets.xml. There is no support for
        msgids in the import of portlets.xml implementation.
        This allows to extract translatable strings with i18ndude.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Added transform to resolve uids.

        1.2rc1 - March 27, 2009
        -----------------------
        
        - The portlet was incorrectly using the 'Manage portlet' permission. It now
        uses a custom permission with the same default roles.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8403.

        1.1.2 - June 1st 2008
        ---------------------

        is not used.  [maurits]

        delete it.  [maurits]
