Description: 
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This package provides base classes for folderish `Archetypes`_ /
        `ATContentTypes`_ content types based on `B-trees`_, a.k.a. "large folders"
        in Plone_.  Storing content in such folders provides significant
        `performance benefits`_ over regular folders.

        The package only contains the integration layer for the base class provided
        by `plone.folder`_, however.  Please see there for more detailed information.

        Caveats
        -------
        
        If you are using `plone.app.folder` in your product you may notice that
        PloneTestCase will fail to setup a Plone site for your functional tests.
        This can be resolved by adding this line to your functional test source::
        
        from plone.app.folder.tests import bbb

        1.0.1 - 2010-07-18
        ------------------
        
        - Update license to GPL version 2 only.
        [hannosch]
        
        1.0 - 2010-07-07
        ----------------
        
        * Moved migration logic into the BTreeMigrationView to allow subclasses to
        override part of the logic.
        [hannosch]
        
        * Remove the overly noisy migration report per folder.
        [hannosch]
        
        1.0b7 - Released June 3, 2010
        -----------------------------
        
        * Updated tests to not rely on the existence of the Large Plone Folder type,
        which was removed for Plone 4.
        [davisagli]
        
        1.0b6 - Released May 2, 2010
        ----------------------------
        
        * Nogopip vs. Acquisition take two - not all folders have a getOrdering
        method, so we need to avoid acquiring it.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b5 - Released April 6, 2010
        ------------------------------
        
        * Match ``getObjectPositionInParent`` behavior and handle unordered folders
        inside ordered folders shown in the navigation tree at the same time.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b4 - Released March 6, 2010
        ------------------------------
        
        * Don't try to store an acquisition-wrapped catalog on the positional index.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b3 - Released February 18, 2010
        ----------------------------------
        
        * Only apply monkey patch for `reindexOnReorder` on Plone 3.x & shortcut
        indexing completely if the fake index has been installed.
        [witsch]
        
        * Replace monkey patch for `Catalog._getSortIndex` with a fake index that
        can sort search results according to their position in the container.
        [witsch]
        
        * Add optimization for sorting results by folder position for the usual
        "all results in one folder" case.
        [witsch]
        
        * Add adapter for previous/next support that doesn't need the catalog.
        [witsch]
        
        * Remove `getObjPositionInParent` catalog index and use a sort index based
        on the folder's order information instead.
        [witsch]
        
        
        1.0b2 - Released January 28, 2010
        ---------------------------------
        
        * Add `IATBTreeFolder` to `implements` list of `ATFolder` replacement.
        [thet]
        
        
        1.0b1 - Released Nov 15, 2009
        -----------------------------
        
        * Copy the `index_html` method from `ATContentTypes` to better support WebDAV.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Add in-place migration code.
        [witsch]
        
        * Work around imports no longer present in Plone 4.0.
        [witsch]
        
        * (Briefly) document the `plone.app.folder.tests.bbb` usage.
        [wichert]
        
        
        1.0a1 - Released May 7, 2009
