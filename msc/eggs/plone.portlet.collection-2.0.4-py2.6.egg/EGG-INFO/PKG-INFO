        A portlet that fetches results from a collection.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.0.4 (2011-08-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Portlet is shown when user has View permission for the collection.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/12152
        [gotcha]
        
        - Fix failing test.
        [davisagli]
        
        2.0.3 - 2011-07-04
        ------------------
        
        - Change the `target_collection` query to use a `portal_type` instead of an
        `object_provides` restriction. The data for the former is much more likely
        in the ZODB cache as many catalog queries use it.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fix 'Show more...' handling so it doesn't cause portletFooter to disappear.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9415.

        2.0.2 - 2011-05-18
        ------------------
        
        - Fix memoization of results when randomizing. We only memoize on the instance,
        in this case the rendered object, which is created per request and per
        portlet.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Pass on `limit` setting from the portlet to the `queryCatalog` call, to take
        advantage of optimizations inside the catalog.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Add MANIFEST.in.
        [WouterVH]
        
        - Add metadata.xml to profile.
        [WouterVH]
        
        - Added a dynamic dl class, generated from portlet's title. Code taken from
        plone.portlet.static.

        2.0.1 - 2011-01-03
        ------------------
        
        - Add Site Administrator to the default roles for the
        "plone.portlet.collection: Add collection portlet" permission, for forward
        compatibility with Plone 4.1.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Removed bug where a resultset with fewer items than limit wasn't randomized.
        [jaroel]
        
        - Removed Plone 3 specific implementation in favor of a generic one.
        [jaroel]
        
        - Fixed returning optional randomized results in the collection
        portlet.  This happened on Plone 4; if this makes the portlet too
        slow for you, you should switch off the randomizing.
        [maurits]
        
        - Fixed wrong exception handling in random collection portlet that
        failed to catch an IndexError.
        [maurits]
        
        
        2.0 - 2010-07-18
        ----------------
        
        - Update license to GPL version 2 only.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Add fix for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9198 so that
        typeUseViewActionInListings is respected.
        [aaronv]
        
        - Removed msgids in portlets.xml. There is no support for
        msgids in the import of portlets.xml implementation.
        This allows to extract translatable strings with i18ndude.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Add fix for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9184 so that
        restrictedTraverse always gets a string and not Unicode.

        [davisagli]
        
        
        1.1.2 - 2008-06-01
        ------------------

        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.1.0 - 2008-04-20
        ------------------
        
        - Added missing i18n markup to portlets.xml.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Changed the i18n domain to `plone`.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b1 - 2008-03-08
        ------------------
        
        - Fix a typo in the CSS classes.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Set default_query to get something to browse in the UberSelectionWidget from
        the start.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Code cleanup and make showing of dates for items and a 'Show more...' link
        configurable.
        [optilude]
        
        
        0.1.1 - 2007-11-19
        ------------------
        
        - Set zip-safe flag for the egg to False so zcml can be correctly loaded.
        [wichert]
        
        - Remove non-ASCII characters form the description since PyPI can not handle
        them.
        [wichert]
