Description: Various z3c.form date and datetime widgets
        ==========================================
        
        Improved datetime widgets for z3c.form
        
        When the emphasis of the application you are designing is on speed and
        speed alone, then the single field pattern might be your friend. It's
        particularly useful for data entry applications in which the person
        who has to enter the data will have to use the same input form time
        and time again.

        The ``collective.z3cform.datetimewidget`` library provides a form framework
        and widgets. This document ensures that we implement a widget for Date and
        Datetime field defined in ``zope.schema``. Take a look at the different widget
        doctest files for more information about the widgets.

        =========
        
        
        1.0.5 (2011-06-28)
        ------------------
        
        * Change more $ to jQuery.
        [danjacka]
        
        * Fix month selection issue with the date input widget.  Previously, due
        to the leading zero, months < 10 weren't being selected when picking a
        date on the calendar widget.
        [davidjb]
        
        * Fix date offset issue for default dates on the jQuery date input widget.
        Providing the default value as a JavaScript Date(yyyy, mm, dd) required
        months to be in the range of 0 to 11 but outputting as Date("yyyy/mm/dd")
        works as expected.
        [davidjb]
        
        * Fix issue with jQuery date input widget not being displayed when
        an incomplete date was entered.
        [davidjb]
        
        * Avoid error fetching widget values when no year or day was entered.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Made js for dateinput popup check for jQuery().dateinput before invoking
        it. Changed from $ to jQuery.

        I get an error when adding values like '99' into the year field:
        "ValueError: year=99 is before 1900; the datetime strftime() methods require
        year >= 1900"
