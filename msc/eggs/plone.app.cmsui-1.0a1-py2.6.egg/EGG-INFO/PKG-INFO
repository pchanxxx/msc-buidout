Description: ============
        Introduction
        ============
        
        .. contents:: Contents
        
        plone.app.cmsui installs a new content management user interface for Plone.
        For the moment, it is an experiment only, but hopefully one that will point
        the way towards Plone's future.
        
        The main premise of plone.app.cmsui is to put all the content management
        user interface elements into a separate package, with its own, isolated styles
        and JavaScript files, injected into the page and displayed overlaying the
        content page. The idea is that no matter how you theme your site, and what
        you install, you should not be able to break the editing and administration
        UI.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can use the following buildout to test plone.app.cmsui against
        Plone 4.1rc3 - update versions as applicable::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = instance
        extends =
        http://good-py.appspot.com/release/plone.app.cmsui/1.0a1?plone=4.1rc3
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        user = admin:admin
        eggs =
        Plone
        plone.app.cmsui
        
        Make sure you install the "CMS User Interface" profile when creating your
        Plone site.
        
        Using with Diazo
        ================
        
        If you are using Diazo and plone.app.theming, you can enable the CMS UI in
        your site by including the following rule::
        
        <before css:theme-children="body" css:content="#plone-cmsui-trigger" />
        
        Theme and resource bundles
        ==========================
        
        All CMS UI resources are loaded in a theme (in the portal_skins sense) called
        'cmsui'. Using the concept of resource bundles (in Products.ResourceRegistries
        2.1a1), resources are segregated between this theme and the theme (probably
        'Sunburst Theme') used for the public site.
        
        Participation and conventions
        =============================
        
        See http://projects-wiki.plone.org/display/NEWUI/Home for details about how
        to participate, the rationale behind the project, and related information.
        Log in with your plone.org username.
        
        The following rules and conventions apply:
        
        * No functionality should live in this package, only views and associated
        user interface logic.
        * Dependencies on other packages should be minimised: With the exception
        of edit forms and the control panel, the goal is to move all the editing
        views into this package, so that they can be maintained consistently.
        * There is a ``bbb`` subpackage that contains overrides and integration
        code required for this package to install on a clean Plone 4.1 site. In
        time, this package should be entirely removed and the changes propagated
        to the relevant parts of Plone, if and when this package is merged via the
        PLIP process.
