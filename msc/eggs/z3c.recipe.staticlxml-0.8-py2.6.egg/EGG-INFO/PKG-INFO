Description: *******************************************************************
        Recipe for building and installing a static version of the lxml egg
        *******************************************************************
        
        This recipe automates the installation of the ``lxml`` python package
        and, additionally, builds it **statically** against dependent libraries
        like ``libxml2``, ``libxlst``.

        **********************
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        **egg**
        Set to the desired lxml egg, e.g. ``lxml`` or ``lxml==2.1.2``
        
        **libxslt-url, libxml2-url**
        The URL to download the source tarball of these libraries from.
        If unset, the [versions] section of the buildout is searched,
        if nothing is found there, either, these default values are used::
        
        http://dist.repoze.org/lemonade/dev/cmmi/libxslt-1.1.24.tar.gz
        http://dist.repoze.org/lemonade/dev/cmmi/libxml2-2.6.32.tar.gz
        
        **build-libxslt, build-libxml2**
        Set to ``true`` (default) if these should be build, ``false`` otherwise.
        Needes to be ``true`` for a static build.
        
        **static-build**
        ``true`` or ``false``.  On OS X this defaults to ``true``.
        
        **xml2-location**
        Needed if ``libxml2`` is not built.
        
        **xslt-location**
        Needed if ``libxslt`` is not built.
        
        **xslt-config**
        Path to the ``xslt-config`` binary.  Not needed if ``build-libxslt`` is
        set to true.
        
        **xml2-config**
        Path to the ``xml2-config`` binary.  Not needed if ``build-libxml2`` is
        set to true.
        
        **force**
        Set to ``true`` to force rebuilding libraries every time.
        
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        This is an example buildout::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        lxml
        pylxml
        develop = .
        
        log-level = DEBUG
        
        download-directory = downloads
        download-cache = downloads
        
        versions=versions
        
        [versions]
        lxml = 2.1.3
        
        
        [pylxml]
        recipe=zc.recipe.egg
        interpreter=pylxml
        eggs=
        lxml
        
        [lxml]
        recipe = z3c.recipe.staticlxml
        egg = lxml
        
        This will build a ``static`` version of the ``lxml`` egg, that is, it won't have
        any dependencies on ``libxml2`` and ``libxslt``.
        
        The egg is installed in your buildout's egg directory (it is *not* installed
        as a development egg).  If you have a global ``eggs-directory`` configured in
        your ``~/.buildout/default.cfg``, the static lxml egg is thus placed in that
        global egg directory.
        
        If you specified a specific version for the lxml egg, the egg directory is
        checked for an existing lxml egg. If found, it is used as-is. Specifying
        ``force = true`` of course means that this check isn't performed.
        
        Sanity check
        ============
        
        This is not a complete exercise of all the ways the recipe can be configured,
        rather it's a sanity check that all parts (especially, recipes we depend on)
        work as expected:
        
        >>> write('buildout.cfg',
        ... """
        ... [buildout]
        ... parts = lxml
        ... newest = false
        ...
        ... [lxml]
        ... recipe = z3c.recipe.staticlxml
        ... libxml2-url = file://%s/foo.tgz
        ... libxslt-url = file://%s/foo.tgz
        ... xml2-config = none
        ... xslt-config = none
        ... egg = lxml
        ... static-build = false
        ... """ % (distros, distros))
        
        >>> print system('bin/buildout')
        Installing lxml.

        Change history
        **************
        
        0.8 (2011-08-12)
        ================
        
        - Updated default libxml/libxslt download locations to
        http://xmlsoft.org/sources/libxml2-2.7.8.tar.gz and
        http://xmlsoft.org/sources/libxslt-1.1.26.tar.gz respectively. Those updated
        versions fix a Lion compile issue as reported by jladage.
        
        - Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of depreacted
        ``zope.testing.doctest``.
        
        
        0.7.2 (2010-08-13)
        ==================
        
        - Made smoke test a bit more fuzzy to ignore output differences when newer
        zc.recipe.cmmi versions are used or tests are running on Mac OS X.
        
        - Fixed "relocation R_x86_64_32" error on 64 bit linux by using --with-pic as
        extra option to the libxml/libxslt build.  [reinout]
        
        0.7.1 (2009-05-18)
        ==================
        
        - Removed accidentally checked in pdb [wosc]
        - Updated our use of zc.recipe.cmmi, which from 1.2.0 on *requires* the URL to
        be known on construction time. (The new usage is backward-compatible with
        1.1.x). [wosc]
        
        0.7 (2009-05-18)
        ================
        
        - Passing include-dirs, library-dirs and rpath newline separated as required
        by zc.recipe.egg. This fixes non static build on linux.  [zagy]
        - Consult buildout's [version] section for the libxml2/libxslt-URLs [wosc]
        
        0.6 (2009-03-19)
        ================
        
        - Switching off building of the exslt crypt functionality. That crypt
        functionality isn't found anymore on exslt.org itself. And it uses
        libgcrypt, which somehow leads to runtime errors regarding 'gcry_*' on osx
        and sometimes on linux.  [reinout]
        
        0.5 (2009-03-16)
        ================
        
        - The recipe checks for an existing egg before doing expensive
        download/compiles. Previously, the check was implicitly done *after*
        compiling libmxl/libxslt. The egg name is printed with a warning to delete
        it if this isn't a proper static egg.  [reinout]
        
        - Fixed readme typos. [seletz]
        
        0.4 (2009-02-18)
        ================
        
        - Fix to prevent rebuilding lxml all the time, thus reducing the lxml tax. [seletz]
        
        0.3 (2008-12-01)
        ================
        
        - Only add ``iconv`` on darwin. [seletz]
        
        0.2.1 (2008-11-28)
        ==================
        
        - Made ``static-build`` default to ``true`` on OS X [seletz]
        - Made ``build-libxslt`` and ``build-libxml2`` default to ``true`` [seletz]
        - Document default options [seletz]
        
        0.2 (2008-11-27)
        ================
        
        - Fix Documentation REsT [seletz]
        - Rerelease due to setup.cfg messup [seletz]
        
        0.1 (2008-11-27)
        ================
        
        - Added ``iconv`` library, which enables fully static builds. This is
        actually a bug in lxml's setup. [seletz]
        - Updated docs, removed junk code [seletz]
        - Added tweaks needed for Mac OS X [seletz]
        - Added basic build steps for liblxml2, libxslt and lxml. [seletz]
        - Created recipe with ZopeSkel [seletz].
