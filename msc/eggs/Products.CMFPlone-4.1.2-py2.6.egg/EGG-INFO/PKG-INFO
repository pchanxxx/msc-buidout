        ===========
        
        Plone is a user friendly Content Management System running on top of Python,
        Zope and the CMF.
        
        It benefits from all features of Zope/CMF such as: RDBMS integration,
        Python extensions, Object Oriented Database, Web configurable workflow,
        pluggable membership and authentication, Undos, Form validation, amongst many
        many other features. Available protocols: FTP, XMLRPC, HTTP and WEBDAV
        Turn it into a distributed application system by installing ZEO.
        
        Plone shares some of the qualities of Livelink, Interwoven and Documentum. It
        aims to be *the* open source out-of-the-box publishing system.
        
        What is Plone?
        --------------
        
        Plone is a ready-to-run content management system that is built on the powerful
        and free Zope application server. Plone is easy to set up, extremely flexible,
        and provides you with a system for managing web content that is ideal for
        project groups, communities, web sites, extranets and intranets.
        
        - *Plone is easy to install.* You can install Plone with a a click and run
        installer, and have a content management system running on your computer in
        just a few minutes.
        
        - *Plone is easy to use.* The Plone Team includes usability experts who have
        made Plone easy and attractive for content managers to add, update, and
        maintain content.
        
        - *Plone is international.* The Plone interface has more than 35 translations,
        and tools exist for managing multilingual content.
        
        - *Plone is standard.* Plone carefully follows standards for usability and
        accessibility. Plone pages are compliant with US Section 508, and the W3C's
        AAA rating for accessibility.
        
        - *Plone is Open Source.* Plone is licensed under the GNU General Public
        License, the same license used by Linux. This gives you the right to use
        Plone without a license fee, and to improve upon the product.
        
        - *Plone is supported.* There are over three hundred developers in the Plone
        Development Team around the world, and a multitude of companies that
        specialize in Plone development and support.
        
        - *Plone is extensible.* There is a multitude of add-on products for Plone to
        add new features and content types. In addition, Plone can be scripted using
        web standard solutions and Open Source languages.
        
        - *Plone is technology neutral.* Plone can interoperate with most relational
        database systems, open source and commercial, and runs on a vast array of
        platforms, including Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris and BSD.
        
        Technical overview
        ------------------
        
        Plone is a content management framework that works hand-in-hand and sits on top
        of Zope, a widely-used Open Source web application server and development
        system. To use Plone, you don't need to learn anything about Zope; to develop
        new Plone content types, a small amount of Zope knowledge is helpful, and it is
        covered in the `documentation`_.
        
        Zope itself is written in Python, an easy-to-learn, widely-used and supported
        Open Source programming language. Python can be used to add new features to
        Plone, and used to understand or make changes to the way that Zope and Plone
        work.
        
        By default, Plone stores its contents in Zope's built in transactional object
        database, the ZODB. There are products and techniques, however, to share
        information with other sources, such as relational databases, LDAP, filesystem
        files, etc.
        
        Plone runs on Windows, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and many other platforms;
        double-click installers are available for Windows and Mac OS X, and RPM
        packages are available for Linux. For full information, see the
        `plone.org product page`_.

        ------------------
        
        - Allow users with the Manage Users permission to change the login
        name of other users; specifically this allows them to change the
        email address when this is used as login name.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11255
        [maurits]
        
        - Re-enable the getObjPositionInParent index in the portal_atct tool.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11151
        [davisagli]
        
        - Removed the 'What' row in the event view that displayed the
        keywords; this is already handled by the keywords viewlet.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10818
        [maurits]
        
        - Fix PloneTool.changeOwnershipOf to not pass MemberData to the underlying
        Owned.changeOwnership, but a plain User object only.
        [stefan]
        
        4.1.1 (2011-09-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed folder_listing template
        so that listing macro can be used outside of folder_listing.
        [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - AuthenticatedUsers group is used for local roles etc, and is not the same
        as Authenticated role. Thus, it can not be optimized away in catalog queries.
        [tesdal]
        
        - getFolderContents only sets b_size if batching is true.
        [do3cc]
        
        4.1 - 2011-07-12
        ----------------
        
        - Make the ``plone-final`` import step dependend on ``rolemap`` to
        prevent some hard-to-debug add-on product related issues.
        Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11997;
        [MatthewWilkes]
        
        - Use ``transaction.savepoint`` instead of ``transaction.begin`` in
        ``isLinked``;
        closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7784; does not reopen
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6666 probably because we use fixed version
        of ZEO
        [gotcha]
        
        - Fix: content status history form entries are not batched because there is
        no batch navigation management on this page,
        so that all selected elements from folder contents are displayed.
        [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Optimized: Huge optimization of calendar_formfield.js under ie8 and lower.
        Gain of 50% on js execution on a large page.
        [thomasdesvenain]
        
        4.1rc3 - 2011-06-02
        -------------------
        
        - Apply patches to prevent exploitation of CVE-2011-1948 (Hotfix 20110531.)
        [elro]
        
        - In actions.xml, use object_url for the object_buttons.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11733.
        [WouterVH]
        
        - Set Language to 'all' to list content in all languages when listing a
        worklist's contents (workflow) to support LinguaPlone better.
        [mj]
        
        - Set appropriate cache headers on createObject redirects to prevent caching
        by proxy servers.
        [elro]
        
        - Added "X-Theme-Disabled" response header to failsafe_login_form to disable
        Diazo/plone.app.theming.
        [elro]
        
        - Fixed PloneBatch to work for non-lazy sequences.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Explicitly load the `configure.zcml` from `plone.app.upgrade`, so the upgrade
        steps are loaded in `plone.app.testing` based test layers.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Define a ZCML feature called `plone-41` in addition to the existing `plone-4`
        to be used in conditional ZCML registrations.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid registering CMFDefault's upgrade steps, as they are not useful in Plone.
        [hannosch]
        
        4.1rc2 - 2011-05-21
        -------------------
        
        - Fixed PloneBatch class to handle limited result sets correctly. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11733.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Hide datepicker icon for date widget if plone.jscalendar is not loaded.
        Fixes #11831.
        [smcmahon]
        
        4.1rc1 - 2011-05-20
        -------------------
        
        - Make folder_listing filter on @@portal_state/friendly_types when applied to
        a container. (Add portal_types to site_properties types_not_to_list to
        exclude them from friendly_types.)
        [elro]
        
        - Error handling for folder_full_view_item so items using a BrowserView render
        a link instead of causing an error.
        [elro]
        
        - Refactor dragdropreorder.js and folder_moveitem to detect client/server
        ordering mismatches and be more robust in event of mousing out of the table
        rows.
        [elro]
        
        - Add forward compatibility with DateTime 3.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added a new interface blacklist to the `CatalogTool` module. Items in this
        list won't be indexed in the object_provides index. This saves about 1kb of
        mostly useless data to be stored per object. If you need to query on one of
        the blacklisted interfaces, consider using other indexes to get a small
        result set and then checking the actual objects or add a specialized index
        for the data you are interested in. Also changed the stored value to a tuple
        to safe some memory overhead of the list type.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Optimize images and icon file sizes.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fix the event_view to refer to the `icon_export_*` images relative to the
        portal and not the current context.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Text on login success page uses navigation root title instead of portal title.
        Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9175.
        [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Let the content import step (importing the site structure) not
        depend on plone-final but on typeinfo.  Solves circular dependency.
        Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8350
        [maurits]
        
        - Set Content-Language header to default language when content language is an
        empty string.
        [elro]
        
        - Change csrf patch to apply to MemberAdapter instead of MemberData when using
        CMF 2.3.
        [elro]
        
        - CMFCore registers a memberdata export/import handler in 2.3, so make our
        registration conditional.
        [elro]
        
        - Remove `previous` sub-collection from default content, as sub-collections are
        not enabled by default since Plone 4.0 and having one in the default content
        is confusing. Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10705.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fix zope.sendmail patch to raise errors for immediate sending failures.
        Relates to http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10675.
        [elro]
        
        - Sort on content title ignores accents.
        So, d < é < f.
        [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Expose the query report and plan on the catalog tool.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Optimize the data indexed by the `allowedRolesAndUsers` index and the query
        performed against it.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fix cicular dependency in import steps.
        This partially fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8350
        [kiorky]
        
        4.1b2 - 2011-04-06
        ------------------
        
        - Fix bug in formUnload.js where changes to select option lists without a
        default were incorrectly detected (javascript indexes from 0, not 1.)
        [elro]
        
        - Added "rss" alias to "RSS".
        This fixes https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11638.
        [gotcha]
        
        - Fixed: "showing field with error is broken in edit view"

        - Make wicked an optional dependency. (It is still pulled in by the Plone
        distribution.)
        [davisagli]
        
        - Fix import of RoleManager to avoid deprecation warning.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Update MigrationTool.getSoftwareVersion to return Products.CMFPlone version.
        [elro]
        
        4.1b1 - 2011-03-06
        ------------------
        
        - Remove useless trailing slash in 404.
        This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11550
        [gotcha]
        
        - Remove invocation of do_search_collapse from advanced search form.
        It caused the function to run twice, making collapsibles wink
        rather than open. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11565
        [smcmahon]
        
        - Use correct argument order in utranslate.py script.

        - Discontinue tagging plone_3rd party as a separate external.
        [esteele]
        
        4.1a2 - 2011-02-10
        ------------------
        
        - On search form don't show list of users when anonymous
        unless explicitly allowed in @@security-controlpanel.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11346
        [msmith64]
        
        - Add fallback icon for control panels with no icon, in the portlet_prefs

        [topherh, davisagli]
        
        - Use the new optimized BooleanIndex for the `is_default_page` and
        `is_folderish` indexes and the new `UUIDIndex` for the `UID` index.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Remove js-generated inline style from searchbox. Same CSS is in public.css.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/tickets/11186.
        [msmith64]

        - Removing unused import from testCatalogTool.
        [thet]
        
        - Alphabetical ordering of metadata.xml dependencies.
        [thet]
        
        - Using tom gross' improved and tested safeToInt version.
        [tom_gross, thet]
        
        - Move PlacefulWorkflow, kupu, iterate and openid to Plone egg dependencies.
        [elro]
        
        - Depend on plone.app.uuid for indexing content UUIDs.
        [toutpt, davisagli]
        
        - Added ++resource++blank.html, a building block for cross-domain iframe
        communication (e.g. with Disqus.)
        [elro]
        
        - Added iframe option for single sign on login templates.
        [elro]
        
        - Removed duplicate code in login templates.
        [elro]
        
        - Added ajax_include_head request parameter for use with cross domain iframe.
        [elro]
        
        - Single Sign On support in login forms.
        [elro]
        
        - Refactored ``URLTool.isURLInPortal``, adding ``allow_external_login_sites``
        property to ``site_properties`` for external sites considered to be internal
        for the purposes of logging in.
        [elro]
        
        - Improve table sort of 'listing' class tables. We can use a sortabledata-xxxx
        class in a cell (td) where xxxx is a sortable data value, then, sort uses xxxx
        value to compare cell values, instead of td text content.
        Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket10809
        [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Merge in PLIP #10901: Set and enforce base coding standards for our own

        - Renamed package to `Products.CMFPlone`.
        [elro]
        
        - Deprecated the following scripts that are only used by deprecated templates.
        These will be removed in Plone 5: prefs_group_edit.py,
        prefs_valid_search_restriction.py, prefs_user_group_search.py,
        prefs_portrait_delete.py.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Replaced the prefs_group_details.pt template with a browser view in
        plone.app.controlpanel. Ss a side effect this means group creation is now
        protected by the Plone Users and Groups control panel permission, rather than
        the CMF Manage Groups permission.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Turn plone_control_panel.pt into a deprecated alias for the
        @@overview-controlpanel view from plone.app.controlpanel.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Protect most control panels with specific permissions instead of the generic
        "Manage portal".
        [davisagli]
        
        - Configure the Site Administrator role in the default rolemap and workflows.
        This role is intended for people who should have full content editing
        privileges but not Manager access (i.e. to the ZMI).
        [davisagli]
        
        - Updated to use Zope 2.13.
