    This package contains two handlers for the python logging
    framework that enable important log entries to be sent by email.

    This can either be as the entries are logged or as a summary at
    the end of the running process.

    The handlers have the following features:
    
    - customisable and dynamic subject lines for emails sent

    - emails sent with configurable headers for easy filtering
    
    - flood protection to ensure the number of emails sent is not
      excessive

    - support for SMTP servers that require authentication

    - configurable log entry filtering

    - fully documented and tested
    
    In addition, extra support is provided for configuring the
    handlers when using ZConfig, Zope 2 or Zope 3.

    To install, either:

    - Extract the .tar.gz and do the usual:

      python setup.py install
    
    - use easy_install mailinglogger

    For full documentation, start with the readme.txt in the source distribution.
